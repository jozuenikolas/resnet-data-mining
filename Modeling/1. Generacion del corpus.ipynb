Literature Review of Resilient Indicators The capacity to respond and adapt to risks and problems in an organization is critical for business success. Any type of weakness causes inefficient use of resources. On the contrary, flexible facilities can ensure the continuity of operations in the face of disruptive events, which significantly harm the company. However, flexibility is not achieved only with the optimization of facilities, as resilient approaches can enhance it. This research synthesizes the variables and indicators with greater use in three different areas, business resilience, textile industry, and the facility layout problem (FLP). A systematic literature review was conducted, considering 99 studies published in 2010–2021. The documents were analyzed using the Atlas.ti software, a 4W (When, Who, What, and Where) analysis, and three research questions posed through the PICO strategy. The findings indicate that the scientific interest regarding resilience has been increasing in the last six years, specifically in evaluation methods and approaches to identify resilience factors and indicators in the industry through fuzzy mathematical models. It is also highlighted the scarcity of resilient FLP studies the importance of indicators for an accurate model. Finally, a set of possible indicators for the facility layout design with a resilient approach based on FLP factors is proposed. Management by\\xa0Integrated Processes with\\xa0Biosafety Parameters. Case Study SMEs Manufacturing Rest Footwear in\\xa0the\\xa0Province of\\xa0Tungurahua This study aimed to provide an administrative management methodology through a process management approach integrated with biosafety applications and information technology integration. The operative processes of a manufacturing SMEs (Small and medium-sized enterprises) of rest footwear (slippers) in the province of Tungurahua were established as a case study. Through bibliographic research, knowledge was determined and consolidated regarding preventive measures against COVID-19, management by processes and actions for the safe return to work centres, as well as a model for integrating IT (Information technology) into the organization’s processes. A model for the integration of new technologies into the processes of the companies was established, together an analysis of the situation of the company was carried out, the survey of the processes to know the organizational structure and the identification of all the productive activities of each one of the operative processes. Finally, safe work practices, good biosafety practices, hygiene measures in the workplace were established, ensuring biosafety conditions and work standards in safer environments. A Systematic Literature Review of Facility Layout Problems and Resilience Factors in the Industry Flexibility, quick responses to changes, and capacity to respond to external factors are strategies that companies must develop to ensure their continuity and face adverse situations. The flexibility that can be acquired by optimizing plant layout and resilience ensures continuity of production by reducing adverse external shocks. This article synthesizes critical elements used in models to solve facility layout problems, followed by analyzing the resilience variables and factors most frequently applied in the industry. A systematic literature review to achieve this objective was developed, including 170 articles published in 2010 and 2021. Its study was performed through the Atlas.ti software, an analysis of the 4W's (i.e., When, Who, What, and Where) was applied, and finally, answers to three research questions posed were given. Growth in the scientific interest of facility layout problems can be observed in the last five years, especially for dynamic problems and unequal areas, development of multi-objective models, and approach to metaheuristic solutions. Eventually, research gaps were also identified, highlighting the lack of inclusion of resilience factors in plant distribution models.

An Overview of Optimization Models and Technological Trends of Logistics in the Retail Sector Recently, the e-commerce market has grown rapidly. For example, e-commerce generated sales of USD 504 billion in the US from January 1, 2020, to July 1, 2020, representing an increase of 11.58% over the same period in 2019. This growth has forced the retail industry has had to adopt strategies to become more efficient. About 40% of many companies ‘available time is devoted to logistics. Because these activities are consuming a disproportionate share of many companies’ time, logistics is a prime topic of interest. In this context, this study aims to present an overview of optimization models and technological trends in logistics in the retail sector. Findings show that retail logistics has focused on reducing costs, time usage, and inventories while increasing transport capacity. Optimization in logistics has focused on using mathematical algorithms such as genetic algorithms with different variants, and simulation has supported testing optimization proposals. Finally, big data, omnichannel, and e-commerce continue to grow, especially in the retail sector where it has grown considerably. Decision-Making of the University Libraries’ Digital Collection Through the Publication and Citation Patterns Analysis. A Literature Review In recent years, different bibliometric methods and indicators, data mining techniques, and collection and visualization tools have been presented to analyze publication patterns and citations of scientific production. Moreover, some criteria and strategies for acquiring bibliographic databases allow forming a knowledge base for decision-making. Unfortunately, these data, methods, and tools are scattered in the literature. In this context, the objective of this article is to determine if the discovery of publication and citation patterns is being used to analyze scientific production in university libraries that helps decision-making on the subscription/acquisition of bibliographic databases. Fink’s methodology was applied in conjunction with the PICO structure for the literature review. This systematic review made it possible to compile relevant information from 167 articles published during the 2016–2020 period into a findings matrix and perform a metadata and content analysis. Among the study’s primary results, it stands out that the analysis of citations, the number of citations, and the VOSviewer collection and visualization tool have been the most outstanding for the study of scientific production. However, it has not had a significant impact as an aid to the acquisition/subscription of bibliographic databases. Textile Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Layout Dynamics in the Ecuadorian Context Micro, small, and medium enterprises’ (MSME) role in developing national economies is critical. These enterprises constantly search for effective tools to improve their production processes. However, methodologies proposed by numerous authors are not explicitly adapted to the size of such companies. MSMEs have been developed according to their specific needs, using particular procedures and adapting to a lack of financial resources to invest in substantial improvements. This study seeks to identify the characteristics, needs, and general context that impact layout planning decisions in textile MSMEs. This work proposes an evaluation tool that has been developed within different stages. These stages included a literature review, validation of the information obtained, and the application of the resulting tool in three case studies of textile MSMEs that face different situations. There are marked differences and similarities in the three textile enterprises, making it possible to identify the most important decisions that should be made when planning the layout for their production processes. Technologies Applied to Solve Facility Layout Problems with Resilience – A Systematic Review In the industry, the need to optimize daily tasks became mainly a requirement to stay competitive. The Facility Layout Problem (FLP) arises from this need and is the most used technique to improved manufacturing processes. Over the years, the distribution of the different facilities became more complex and more susceptible to interventions in their usual workflow. Hence, FLPs emerged to solve these interventions. This capacity to solve various problems is known as resilience. By searching the literature for information on technologies used to solve FLP, many software solutions can be obtained. Still, none of them manage resilience as a factor in the solution. They have also not been compiled in an analysis to determine the most modern options for existing solutions. The current study reviews the most widely used software tools that solve FLP and how these studies view resilience. A systematic literature review was applied to select relevant studies from 2015–2021. This work allowed analyzing a final sample of 133 articles obtained in two different search strings. As a result, this study identified two manners to solve FLP with software tools: using already developed tools and developing an own tool. In the former, three proprietary software were identified: MATLAB, CPLEX, and LINGO. When developing their software tool, the technology used varies significantly between studies. They use very different language programming, depending on the researcher’s domain. Furthermore, the results do not find any case in which some resilience factor was part of the solution obtained. A Systematic Literature Review of Facility Layout Problems and Resilience Factors in the Industry Flexibility, quick responses to changes, and capacity to respond to external factors are strategies that companies must develop to ensure their continuity and face adverse situations. The flexibility that can be acquired by optimizing plant layout and resilience ensures continuity of production by reducing adverse external shocks.

Internal Logistics Optimization Based on a Multi-objective Linear Model for Micro, Small, and Medium Textile Enterprises Daily, textile companies seek to increase production levels through available resources and improve their profit projections over time. Therefore, it is essential to manage the products to be manufactured based on their raw materials resources and time availability. This work proposes improving decision-making in textile production planning by applying a multi-objective linear optimization model to internal logistics within micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) of the Ecuadorian textile sector. The application of this optimization model results in a balanced production plan between the objectives related to profit maximization and the use of the time available for production. This article includes the description of the studied case, the definition of the optimization model executed by using the Gurobi solver, the results of the application of the optimization model with the data provided by a case study, and the discussion of the results through a sensitivity analysis. Optimization Models Used in the Textile Sector: A Systematic Review In recent years, several works have been published dedicated to obtaining optimization models. Many of them have been applied in the textile sector because they are part of the economic development areas of a country. This article’s main objective is to review the literature published on optimization models and understand what methods their authors used to solve the optimization problems in the textile sector. A systematic methodology was applied to select research questions, digital databases, and search terms to utilize practical and methodological filters later to carry out this systematic review. This procedure allowed performing a review and synthesis of the results obtained on the optimization models. It was found that the models resulting from the systematic review vary depending on the areas to be optimized. The most frequent applications were logistics and production, followed by cost minimization. They were optimized mainly with linear programming, integer programming, Markov chains, genetic algorithms, and multi-objective programming. Demand Forecasting for Textile Products Using Machine Learning Methods Due to its close relationship with various operational decisions, market demand forecasting has been considered one of the essential activities in all organizations. Unfortunately, the textile industry has been the most difficulty generating forecasts, mainly due to the volatility caused in the market by short product life cycles, special events, and competitions. From the beginning, forecasting has been using traditional statistical methods. However, the increasing use of artificial intelligence has opened a new catalog of prediction methods currently being studied for their high precision. This study explores machine learning (ML) as a tool to generate forecasts for the textile industry, applying regression-focused algorithms such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, K-nearest neighbor, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest (RF). To this end, time series were used as inputs for the models, supported by external variables such as Google Trends and special events. The results show that ML as a prediction method has higher precision than purely statistical basic prediction models. Additionally, SVR and Ridge models obtain a lower error in metrics such as MSE (0.09787 and 0.09682), RMSE (0.31285 and 0.31117), and RSE (0.32977 and 0.32800), respectively. Meanwhile, Google Trends reduces the MSE error by 2% and 15%, RMSE 1% and 7% and, RSE 1% and 7% for SVR and Ridge models, respectively. Integrating corporate social responsibility and quality management into the TDABC costing system: a case study in the assembly industry Purpose: This paper aims to show the potential of time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) to value and integrate corporate social responsibility (CSR) and quality management (QM) processes in the assembly industry. It provides valuable insights about operational processes, sub-process and activities within assembly companies by using TDABC’s time equations with more accurate costs for the decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper proposes a new methodology framework with four QM and CSR implementation levels and several costing scenarios through the TDABC system. The valuation was built based on the activities of essential referents in each subject, such as ISO, Ethos Institute and electrostatic discharge control programs. To this end, a case study in the assembly industry processes was conducted with data from a TV assembler. Findings: The results highlight that TDABC can be extended to perform a cost analysis with QM and CSR processes. The environmental management and occupational safety and health administration processes were considered part of CSR to do so. Consequently, managers can simulate the cost and impact of incorporating CSR and QM in assembly processes and thus decide the implementation degree and its corresponding planning according to the needs and available resources. In this particular case, the company increases a maximum of 12% of its resources to be socially responsible and manage its products’ quality. Originality/value: Although theoretical models on CSR have been developed, the current study provides a practical framework based on TDABC scenarios that enterprises can easily implement to support and evaluate QM and CSR processes. Management Tools for Process Mapping and Modeling in Assembly Industry In a highly globalized world affected by economic policies and a latent COVID-19 pandemic, companies need to organize or reorganize to achieve efficient operations. The correct management of organizations has led their administrators to adopt resourceful management models that guide their activities towards fulfilling their objectives. Thus, management tools have been presented as an effective alternative to control processes and activities. According to a previous study, the main tools that allow process mapping and modeling are Business Process Management (BPM), Business Process Reengineering (BPR), and Event Process Chain (EPC). This article analyzes their characteristics based on compatibility and affinity with four case studies dedicated to the assembly industry using this previous study. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the three tools related to the possible adaptability in the four companies are studied. This work uses qualitative qualification matrices, which answer specific questions, determine the potential improvement of organizational management, and create a methodology for mapping and modeling processes. New Hybrid Algorithm for Supply Chain Optimization Optimization is the process of obtaining the best solutions to specific problems. In the literature, those problems have been optimized through a plethora of algorithms. However, these algorithms have many advantages but also disadvantages. In this article, a New Hybrid Algorithm for Supply Chain Optimization, NHA-SCO has been proposed in order to improve the benefits of objective function convergence. For the analysis of the results, three assembly companies have been utilized as case studies. These companies present their supply chains, i.e., networks where products flow from their raw material to the final products delivered to clients. These supply chains must satisfy different objectives, such as maximize benefits and service level and minimize scrap. For the evaluation of results, NHA-SCO has been compared to other well-known optimization algorithms. In the presented case studies, the NHA-SCO algorithm performs faster, or it converges in fewer iterations, obtaining similar or even better results than the other algorithms tested. Generic model of processes for assembly companies as a benchmarking strategy for decision making In a demanding market, companies need to manage their processes efficiently and properly to compete in the world of industry and achieve customer satisfaction. This article presents the creation of a generic model of assembly processes, an administrative model based on common operational, strategic, and support sub-processes carried out in assembly companies. For this purpose, the study took as a reference previous work carried out in three case studies, which allowed the diagramming of the model in a tool based on the Business Process Management methodology, BPM. The results were validated with assembly, strategic and support processes of related and not related products obtained from the literature to show that the processes of the generated model can have common as well as different sub-processes. These comparisons allowed analyzing and establishing ideas for improvement of the assembly processes. A Methodological Framework for Creating Large-Scale Corpus for Natural Language Processing Models Currently, there is a boom in introducing Machine Learning models to various aspects of everyday life. A relevant field consists of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that seeks to model human language. A key and basic component for these models to learn properly consists of the data. This article proposes a methodological framework for constructing a large-scale corpus to feed NLP models. The development of this framework emerges from the problem of finding inputs in languages other than English to feed NLP models. With an approach focused on producing a high-quality resource, the construction phases were designed along with the considerations that must be taken. The stages implemented consist of the corpus characterization to be obtained, collecting documents, cleaning, translation, storage, and evaluation. The proposed approach implemented automatic translators to take advantage of the vast amount of English literature and implemented through non-cost libraries. Finally, a case study was developed, resulting in a corpus in Spanish with more than 170,000 documents within a specific domain, i.e., opinions on textile products. Through the evaluations carried out, it is established that the proposed framework can build a large-scale and high-quality corpus. Lean Manufacturing for Optimizing Operational Processes in a Bicycle Assembly Line Manufacturing and assembly industries are continually searching to optimize their resources and achieve improvements in their production systems. At a time when the differentiating factor is found in efficiency and competitiveness in production, Lean Manufacturing (LM) philosophy contributes to these differentiators, focusing mainly on the elimination of waste to obtain an improvement in processes, quality, and delivery times, being evident the results in a short period. This article proposes optimizing processes within a bicycle assembly plant by applying a LM tool called Value Stream Map (VSM), which presents the current production processes and their requirements, facilitating the identification of waste within the system. Regarding process mapping, the bicycle model E26 was selected for illustrative purposes. Additionally, the 5S tool was used to maintain tidiness and cleanliness within the processes for obtaining an agile production flow. The study also included the balancing of lines, getting a reduction of 14% in “cycle time” and 66% in “lead time”, generating a mixed production (push and pull). Moreover, a warehouse distribution of raw material was proposed, obtaining the unification of all the materials involved in the process. Finally, the VSM future’s legitimacy was confirmed through simulation, validating the results obtained from the LM tools’ application. Toward a Sustainability Balanced Scorecard for Managing Corporate Social Responsibility: A Conceptual Model The Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SBSC) allows companies to track organizational operations and measure their impact on company objectives.\\xa0To monitor the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities and ensure its alignment with the company’s strategy, CSR elements need to be integrated into the organization’s dashboards.\\xa0The\\xa0main goals of this study are threefold:\\xa0(1) identify the main CSR elements and the proposal of an analysis scheme for CSR’s strategies; (2) assess local and regional CSR implementations using the previously identified elements, and (3) incorporate the identified CSR metrics into a management dashboard based on the findings of the previous steps. Both a systematic literature review and in-depth analysis of case studies were used in this study. The results show that four elements: principles, dimensions, stakeholders, and means can be applied to analyze CSR strategies consistently. In addition, a structure for a management dashboard that incorporates subcategories and indicators for the assessment of sustainable CSR strategies aligned with the company goals is proposed. Mathematical modeling to standardize times in assembly processes: Application to four case studies Purpose: This paper proposes model-based standard times estimates using multiple linear regression, non-linear optimization, and fuzzy systems in four real cases of assembly lines. The work includes a description of the models and compares their performance with measurements obtained through the conventional chronometer method. These models allow estimating standard times without reconducting field studies. Design/methodology/approach: For the development of the time study, the methodology proposed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) was used as a baseline, which is structured in three phases: the selection of the case study, the registration of the process by direct observation, and the calculation/estimation of the standard time. The selected case studies belong to real assembly lines of motorcycles, television sets, printed circuit boards (PCB), and bicycles. Findings: In the motorcycle’s assembly case, the study allowed the construction of fourteen linear regression models: seven to estimate standard times for assembling the front parts and seven for the rear of the different motorcycle types. Compared to the conventional chronometer method, the results never exceeded 10% of the measured values. Regarding the cases of assembling TV sets and PCBs, the study considered the construction of nonlinear optimization models that allow making appropriate predictions of the standard times in their assembly lines. Finally, for the bicycle assembly line, a fuzzy logic model was constructed and validated to represent the standard time. Research limitations/implications: To ensure the confidentiality of the companies used in the case study: all the names of the companies, services and the models of manufactured products are omitted. Originality/value: The literature consulted does not refer to the representation of standard time on assembly lines using mathematical models. The construction of these models with empirical data from real-assembly lines was a valuable aid to the companies involved in supporting activity planning. Occupational Health and Safety for Decision-Making in the Framework of Corporate Social Responsibility: Models, Guidelines, and Indicators Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) is a primary concern in the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) discussion since the workers’ welfare is one of the main aspects of operating in a socially responsible manner. When searching for information about OSH management models, a large amount of content is obtained; however, they have not been compiled or synthesized for their analysis. The purpose of this study is to define the main models, guidelines, and indicators that allow building a conceptual framework for decision-making regarding the topic of OSH as a component for CSR. A literature review methodology was applied to select relevant information in the period 2009–2018 about OSH in manufacturing industries. This literature review allowed analyzing a final sample of 96 articles. As a result, this paper identifies the most applied OSH models, their benefits and challenges, as well as the main guidelines and indicators to be included as part of an OSH-based management model. PESTEL Analysis as a Baseline to Support Decision-Making in the Local Textile Industry The concept of sustainability has several possible meanings in the Ecuadorian context. This is especially true when it comes to the business sector because of the complexity related to implementing the Good Living concept and honoring the constitutional Rights of Nature. In Ecuador, most of the business sector is represented by micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Thus, their role in the development of national economies is crucial. This sector has difficulty adapting its organizations to the way of sustainable development. In fact, the decision to incorporate the principle of sustainability in this transition period is a big challenge for MSMEs due to their limited resources and the competitive environment they face. This work studies the contextual aspects influencing the regular operations of the Ecuadorian MSMEs, with particular emphasis on the textile industry. To do so, a comprehensive literature review was performed by applying a political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal (PESTEL) analysis. As a result, factors and implications were identified and explained in context, comprehensively, not individually. The information gathered yielded an overview of the sector, which serves as a baseline for the definition of the required models and tools for supporting sustainable decision-making in the local context. Optimization model for the estimation of standard times in the assembly industry In production processes, production times represent an important factor that influences business competitiveness regarding a timely meeting of business objectives. This article proposes a mathematical optimization model based on the minimization of a non-linear objective function, for estimating standard times with a minimum error from a variance analysis (ANOVA) standpoint, in comparison from the results obtained with respect to those achieved with the conventional chronometer methodology. Results are validated using two study cases of assembly lines of televisions and electronic cards. Finally, in order to provide a better understanding of these study cases, in terms of inputs, outputs and processes, the corresponding business process models are developed for the strategic, operational and support levels and the standard times are calculated using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Coordinating learning analytics policymaking and implementation at scale Many Latin-American institutions recognise the potential of learning analytics (LA). However, the number of actual LA implementations at scale remains limited, notwithstanding considerable effort made to formulate guidelines and frameworks to support the LA policy development. Guidance on how to coordinate the interaction between the LA policymaking and implementation is mostly missing, leaving a difficult challenge up to practitioners. In this study we propose a coordination model to support future LA initiatives at scale. We explore the problem by comparing two cases in Belgium and Ecuador. Following up we use the LA implementation timeline as a driver for planning the interaction between the policymaking and implementation. We continue by testing an application of the model with LA experts predominantly from Latin-American institutions, asking them to map low-level items of the SHEILA policy framework to four implementation phases. The results of this mapping support that LA policy building can be spread over\\xa0time, that it can coincide with LA implementation at scale, and that both efforts can be coordinated. It is hoped that this study will provide additional guidance for future Latin-American and other LA initiatives. Analysis of standard-times in assembly companies as support for decision-making The small and medium-sized business sector has been gaining ground in the production of goods and services worldwide, creating a highly competitive environment that forces to improve their decisions to increase productivity and organizational efficiency. A handy tool to achieve these improvements is the study of methods and times, oriented to provide information about processes, time spent in operations, as well as the calculation and improvement of standard times for the optimization of processes and costs. This article describes a procedure for obtaining standard times in operational, strategic, and support processes in four assembly companies: televisions, printed circuit boards, motorcycles, and bicycles. The times obtained in the operational processes were validated through comparisons with results reported in the specialized literature, while the times associated with administrative, strategic, and support processes were analyzed internally for the case studies considered. A Software Architecture Proposal for a Data Platform on Active Mobility and Urban Environment Over time Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have evolved from monolithic software to dynamic platforms interacting with other systems. Consequently, characteristics such as availability, scalability, interoperability, and failure handling have become essential. Due to the vast diversity of applications and user levels, and the growing complexity of data types and models handling geospatial data, information management has developed into a complex, often overlooked task, leading to delayed results and/or disorganization of information. The goal of this paper is to propose a software architecture design to support mobility data collection, analysis, and visualization. The proposal is based on the process for software architectures stated by Bredemeyer Consulting, comprising five stages: commit, requirements, design, validation, and deployment. Likewise, the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) method has been used for the design stage where the selected architectural pattern was Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) since it provides the scalability and interoperability attributes required for this study. The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) has been chosen to identify the risks of the proposal and to evaluate the architecture to ensure that all requirements have been satisfactorily met. The model was validated using the data and projects of the LlactaLAB research group. Time-driven activity-based costing in the assembly industry Costs and their determination play a critical role in all manufacturing companies. The traditional costing system has received criticism resulting from the arbitrary allocation of indirect manufacturing costs. As an important initiative to address its weaknesses, new costing methods such as the Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) have emerged. Unfortunately, up to our knowledge, no investigations have been applied in analyzing assembly companies thoroughly nor considering all the processes necessary to obtain the final products. This article explores the TDABC application in the assembly industry through comparison with traditional volume-based costing by focusing on manual and semi-automatized production. Since the research is descriptive, a multiple-case study design was implemented in the assembly of televisions, motorcycles, and printed circuit boards. The developed methodology allowed determining the existence of factory overhead and direct labor cost variances between two different cost accounting systems, which also affected the unit cost of the products. Findings also highlight the benefits of TDABC application in the assembly industry, along with the shortcomings and future potential of research in this area. Optimization of Assembly Processes Based on Lean Manufacturing Tools. Case Studies: Television and Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) Assemblers In the current global context, where competition is growing, it is necessary to change the ways how companies operate, eliminating waste through the implementation of optimization tools such as the ones included in the Lean Manufacturing (LM) philosophy. LM is defined as a systematic process of waste elimination, which achieves a sustained rate of improvement over time. This research describes an optimization proposal with LM tools, performing an analysis of the processes’ state of two companies focused on the assembly of televisions and Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) for televisions, respectively. Through Value Stream Mapping (VSM), it was possible to identify problems in the production processes within the two case studies. Regarding televisions, the use of various tools such as 5S and Workloads led to the elimination of one workstation, projecting an increase of almost 5% of the units produced in the assembly capacity of the plant. In the case of PCBs, the distances traveled by operators was reduced with the use of plant distribution strategies and the creation of a supermarket to supply post-assembly activities. These actions allowed the company to reduce 35% in traveled distances and increase 3.69% in the number of produced units. Validation of the optimization proposal was done through computer simulations using a process modeling software. Prediction of Standard Times in Assembly Lines Using Least Squares in Multivariable Linear Models Currently, the highly competitive environment of the assembly industries has been an engine for them to seek differentiating factors for improving their efficiency. One of these factors is the study of times and methods (referred to the analysis and the critical and systematic examination of how a task is presently performed, facilitating to find more effective methods), which allows alleviating internal and external aspects that affect productivity and provides the basis for management decision-making. The present work has two primary objectives; firstly, the calculation of standard times within the enterprise operative area and, additionally, the development of a mathematical model for time prediction. For the fulfillment of these purposes, a referential conceptual framework was established about the study of time and the multiple linear regression model. This framework allowed elaborating a procedure for the development of the mathematical prediction model, together with its validation. The study concludes with a discussion on the importance of having models to estimate standard times in business decision making, and the establishment of relevant conclusions. Costing model based on time invested by activity for technological services in higher education institutions: A case study The Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing, TDABC, is a technique generally used in the production sector that has been adapted to the service setting, such as the health sector and libraries. However, its application in technological services has been little explored. This paper proposes a cost model based on the time-driven activity-based for technological services in Higher Education Institutions, using as a case of study a public university in Ecuador. Where, the resource costs and time of each activity and service were utilized to estimate the costs, per minute and totals of each technological service. The findings highlight the importance of knowing the provision of technological services costs since they allow better financial management and constitute a contribution to the information technology area. Integrating Corporate Social Responsibility to a Process-Based Cost Analysis System The high competitiveness in the industrial sector has motivated companies to change their former approaches to include sustainable development as a strategy to generate a positive impact on society and the environment. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a key topic for organizations seeking to achieve sustainable development, but its inclusion in daily practices requires a sophisticated implementation process. This article analyzes strategies to include CSR practices as part of process management within assembly companies. To this end, a previous literature review was performed of the CSR concept and its dimensions to identify the main models and standards used as guides in the subject. Thereby, guidelines, recommendations, and indicators were identified, which can be adopted to operate in a socially responsible manner. As a result, we present an action plan for the CSR implementation, the definition of software tools to support CSR-based management, a conceptual data model, a system architecture for process management and the outline of a CSR evaluation process. Models, Guidelines and Trends for Process Quality Management: A Literature Review Although process quality management is a mainstay for achieving success in business, it does not have a unique concept that helps its definition and application. This is due to a large amount of information that can be found in the existing bibliography, resulted from the countless diversity of opinions and theories that have emerged over time. Consequently, the difficulty to find a solid and valid pronouncement that serves as a basis to build a model of process quality management was one of the reasons to perform this work, intending to define which components or guidelines to be considered for management. With this goal in mind, a systematic literature review has been performed to cover most of the theories and models currently existing around the concept of quality management. This research covers a period of ten years, between 2009 and 2018, focusing on the industrial sector. Among the main results, it has been possible to establish the identification of the most used models of quality management, the most important guidelines, and the main benefits or challenges for the integration of a process quality approach within strategic management. Optimization of Motorcycle Assembly Processes Based on Lean Manufacturing Tools Global competition and economic dynamism force the assembly industry to look for productive philosophies of improvement, optimizing processes, and resources. The challenge in the optimization process involves finding tools that will grant an optimal process. This article proposes a process optimization through the application of Lean Manufacturing tools, with the necessary guidelines analyzed and verified by computational simulation in a motorcycle assembler. Firstly, applying a plant distribution, together with the change of productive system, allowed the reduction of distances, elimination of unnecessary movements, and reprocessing. Then, Pull System reduced the stock of both the product in process and the final product in the warehouse, avoiding the generation of future waste and expenses due to overproduction. Finally, the use of the 5S tool entailed maintaining order and cleanliness inside the plant to facilitate the management of internal resources. In the study reported, an average reduction of 40% in assembly time and an average increase in production of 30% of all motorcycle models that were part of the study are achieved. Blockchain and Its Potential Applications in Food Supply Chain Management in Ecuador In recent years, attention has been directed to the problem of food loss and waste. On the one hand, there is an increasing demand for higher quality fresh produce and products. On the other hand, studies suggest that at least one-third of food production is lost along its supply chain. The most crucial part is constituted by suppliers-retailers-consumers, since it presents the highest percentages of loss or waste. Several works in the literature suggest that the exchange of information is one of the most important means to reduce waste. Shared information can improve decisions regarding the quantity in supplier’s orders and vendor’s inventory allocation among retailers. Based on these needs, the Blockchain technology, developed in recent years to generate secure transactions on different sectors, has the characteristics of decentralization, information security, and reliability. If this technology can be applied as an underlying basis of a supply chain, it could improve exchanges of information and products among all parts of the system. In this context, the current article presents a systematic review on Blockchain in food supply chain management (FSCM) in Ecuador, its main contributions, and potential benefits. Findings indicate that Blockchain in FSCM is a recent research area whose importance is rapidly growing. However, little is known about Ecuadorian studies applying Blockchain. Additionally, no studies have reported the combination of Blockchain and Internet of Things technologies, one of the most prominent and complementary applications of Blockchain. A hybrid algorithm for supply chain optimization of assembly companies A fundamental goal of any system is to get an optimal state. These optimal states can be found in different areas, such as medicine, engineering, or architecture. In the field of industrial engineering, one of its objectives is improving or optimizing company processes in order to increase benefits while reducing costs. In this context, an essential component is the supply chain, which is a network in that different entities, such as manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, transporters, and customers or end-users, are associated. Several optimization algorithms with different approaches have been developed to optimize the supply chain. Nevertheless, they still have problems to fulfill some requirements at once. This research aims to develop a hybrid optimization algorithm that leverages the capabilities of different approaches. This algorithm, which presents a multi-objective optimization schema, meets a tradeoff between the optimization results quality and the runtime. To this end, a manufacturing and assembly company is used as case study to prove the algorithm. The results are also compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms using the same execution environment and general settings. Findings indicate that the hybrid algorithm converges in less time and in most cases, it could reach the global optimal. A process collection methodology towards TDABC costing optimization of IT services: A case study in an ecuadorian university ICT plays a paramount role in successful organizations. In order to achieve organizational goals, ICT services have to be closely overseen. Tools such as costing methods allow managers to be alert. Implementing a costing method for ICT services not only helps to justify investments, but also optimizes the cost of services. However, methodologies related to providing input to develop a costing model are limited. This research ameliorates ICT service management by proposing a process collection methodology that contributes to the creation of a costing model with TDABC. The proposed methodology has been tested in an IT department in an Ecuadorian University. It matched the collected information with ITIL enabling the department to manage its IT service performance. The obtained processes, activities, times and resources from operative IT services displayed substantive input to design a costing model to improve the IT department and; thereby, the organization’s management as a whole. Mathematical model based on linear programming and fuzzy logic for time prediction in bicycle assembly industries In the assembly industry, there is a high degree of uncertainty when identifying operational problems, due to limited resources and inefficient production control. Focusing on the assembly of bicycles, this article presents a model that combines linear programming and fuzzy logic to obtain standard times associated with the production lines of bicycles. The tool used for minimizing the objective function was Excel “Solver”, and its formulation involved the identification of variables, restrictions, constant parameters, working conditions and production rates. The times obtained from the linear programming model entered as variables in the fuzzy logic model, to yield standard times estimates. This study allows an identification of the current state of the productive process, obtaining the maximum benefit in operative resources and working conditions. In addition, the model improves decision making through uncertainty control in production planning. A Software Platform for Processes-Based Cost Analysis in the Assembly Industry Processes and resources management are important current discussions related to decision making in the industrial field. This fact motivates companies to search for management models to improve their processes and services continuously. In order to achieve this purpose, approaches such as Business Process Management (BPM) and Time-Driven Activity-based Costing (TDABC) are used as bases for models design. This article describes the validation process of a software platform constructed using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and TDABC paradigms aimed at analyzing processes costs in assembly companies. This work contemplates a description of the methodologies applied, functionalities implemented and validations steps performed. The platform also serves to generate process diagnosis in assembly companies prior to full BPM implementation. Towards the implementation of a software platform based on BPMN and TDABC for strategic management The strategic management of resources and processes has become a key element to enable industries to achieve their goals of minimising costs and maximising profits. Business Process Management (BPM) and Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) are two important tools that allow business managers to identify both activities performed and resources used within a company. Therefore, taking advantage of the integration of these tools may result in a deeper analysis of the state of a company. This paper presents the development of a platform for integrating Business Process Management Notation (BPMN), to represent and store process flows, and TDABC, to obtain an estimation of their associated costs. To achieve this aim, the study reviews some methodologies used for modelling costing-oriented processes and for estimating process costs. The resulting software is a tool to support the first three phases of the BPM lifecycle, i.e., process identification, discovery and analysis, and the TDABC calculations. Using Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing to Identify Best Practices in Academic Libraries In the current competitive and dynamic environment, libraries must remain agile and flexible, as well as open to new ideas and ways of working. Based on a comparative case study of two academic libraries in Belgium, this research study investigates the opportunities of using Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) to benchmark library processes. To this end, two major research questions are addressed: 1) Can TDABC be used to enhance process benchmarking in libraries? 2) Do results at activity level provide additional insights compared to macro results in a process benchmarking? We first start by describing the TDABC implementation. Then, we discuss and compare the workflow of 10 library processes covering the four principal library functions: acquisition, cataloging, circulation and document delivery. Next, based on the benchmarking exercise, we report and discuss potential processes and performance improvements that can be realized from using library time and costs information, in particular concerning the two libraries analyzed. We conclude this article by discussing the advantages of using TDABC as a tool to enhance process benchmarking in libraries. A holistic approach to supporting academic libraries in resource allocation processes E-content revolution, technological advances, and ever-shrinking budgets oblige libraries to efficiently allocate their limited resources between collection and services. Unfortunately, resource allocation is a complex process due to the diversity of data sources and formats required to be analyzed prior to decision making, as well as the lack of efficient methods of integration. The contribution of this article is twofold. We first propose an evaluation framework to holistically assess academic libraries. To do so, a four-pronged theoretical framework is used in which the library system and collection are analyzed from the perspective of users and internal stakeholders. Second, we present a data warehouse architecture that integrates, processes, and stores the holistically based collected data. By proposing this holistic approach, we aim to provide an integrated solution that assists library managers to make economic decisions based on a perspective of the library situation that is as realistic as possible. Literature Review of Data Mining Applications in Academic Libraries This article provides a comprehensive literature review and classification method for data mining techniques applied to academic libraries. To achieve this, forty-one practical contributions over the period 1998-2014 were identified and reviewed for their direct relevance. Each article was categorized according to the main data mining functions: clustering, association, classification, and regression; and their application in the four main library aspects: services, quality, collection, and usage behavior. Findings indicate that both collection and usage behavior analyses have received most of the research attention, especially related to collection development and usability of websites and online services respectively. Furthermore, classification and regression models are the two most commonly used data mining functions applied in library settings.Additionally, results indicate that the top 6 journals of articles published on the application of data mining techniques in academic libraries are: College and Research Libraries, Journal of Academic Librarianship, Information Processing and Management, Library Hi Tech, International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change Management, and The Electronic Library. Scopus is the multidisciplinary database that provides the best coverage of journal articles identified. To our knowledge, this study represents the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature review of data mining techniques applied to academic libraries. Time-Driven activity-based costing systems for cataloguing processes: A case study TDABC is a relatively new costing management technique, initially developed for manufacturing processes, which is gaining attention in libraries. This is because TDABC is a fast and simple method that only requires two parameters, an estimation of time required to perform an activity and the unit cost per time of supplying capacity. A few case studies have been documented with regard to TDABC in libraries; all of them being oriented to analyse specific library activities such as inter-library loan, acquisition and circulation processes. The primary focus of this paper is to describe TDABC implementation in one of the most important library processes, namely cataloguing. In particular, original and copy cataloguing are analysed through a case study to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of TDABC to perform cost analysis of cataloguing processes. Using time-driven activity-based costing to support library management decisions: A case study for lending and returning processes With the rapid increase in the demand for new digital services, the high cost of information, and the dramatic economic slowdown, libraries have been pressured to improve their services at lower costs. To cope with these conditions, library managers must improve their knowledge and understanding of cost behavior, as well as be aware of the different costs involved in the library. Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) is a cost management technique that allows for developing accurate cost information on a wide range of activities. Few case studies have been implemented in libraries regarding very specific processes such as interlibrary loan and acquisition processes. More research is still needed to determine whether TDABC is useful and feasible to implement for a more extensive set of library activities. Through an analysis performed at an academic library in Belgium, this document introduces TDABC as a useful method for supporting lending and returning processes. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.
